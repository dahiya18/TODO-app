TODO app

The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript and its paradigms by creating
a TODO app. This app should be able to add TODOs and track the number of total
TODOs as well as the number of unchecked TODOs.
It also allows to delete TODOs as well.
This should be in the form of a button within each TODO that removes that TODO
when clicked.
